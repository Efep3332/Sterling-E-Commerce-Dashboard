# Sterling-E-Commerce-Dashboard
Sterling E Commerce is a one stop online shopping destination for a wide range of high quality products with the mission to provide customers with the best shopping experience possible, with a focus on quality, affordability, and convenience.
This project is an excel sheet project that creates an interactive dashboard to the Sterling company for proper understanding of their customer's needs, preferences, behavior and patterns or trends. 
In this project, I visuallised the following;
1	Product Analysis: Identifying the most popular product categories, frequently ordered items, and items with the highest quantity ordered.						
2	Geographical Analysis: Analyzing which regions have the highest order frequency, more customers, and order value. Here we will consider region, state, city, county and place name together						
3	Time Analysis: Studying trends related to order dates, customer activity over time, and seasonality. Here we can also analyse the most consistent customers, Old/New customers						
4	Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on their order history, location, and spending patterns.						
5	Customer Behavior Analysis: Understanding how frequently customers place orders, their preferred payment methods, and their total spending.						
6	Gender: which gender patronizes more
